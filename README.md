# Churn Classification - Logistic Regression model and Artificial Neural Network

## Project Goal
The attached Jupyter Notebook contains a Logistic Regression model, Artificial Neural Network, as well as a Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation addressing the following tasks:

## Tasks

### Task 1
    • Load churn_dataset.csv 
    • What is the structure of dataset
    • Which column(s) have null values?
    • Which percentage of null values dataset has?
    • Replace null values with best candidates


### Task 2
    • What are the correlations between input variables and target output Churn?
    • What is your strategy for feature selection? (backward, forward, mixed?)
    • Which features you selected and why?


### Task 3
    • Build, train and evaluate a classifier model
    • Explain why you have selected that specific model

## Models
- Keras: Sequential Classifier
- Scikit-learn: LogisticRegression
- Scikit-learn: Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation
